The price is decent when comparing to MIO, however.  The flavor I bought was actually cherry limeade, which tastes similar to the Great Value powder by the same description and the taste is the same.  As far as \"fantasy fruit\", web reviews say it has a pretty indistinct fruit flavor but it tastes good.I can't comment much on the caffeine content since I'm fairly immune to caffeine at this point.  However, if you're stepping down from caffeinated diet cola to flavored water, as I am, you're probably going to want something like this to ease the transition.  This fits the bill well.My main gripe has to do with value.  I assumed, since this was billed as \"24 servings\" that it would actually flavor 24 x 16.9-ounce bottles of water - but they must be referring to a different amount of water because at that rate, you would NOT be able to taste much of anything besides water.  At best, you might get 10-12 uses out of a bottle if you want actual flavor.Compare that to Great Value powder, which sells for $2 per 10-pack.  Both are similar in price but I find that the powder can flavor two bottles of water.  The liquid enhancer requires a large amount to get any actual flavor.  Since there is no precise measurement, it is hard to tell when you've used too little or too much.The one advantage liquid flavoring has over powder is that it doesn't fly everywhere in a stiff breeze.  When you get the red powder on your clothes (or anything porous), it is very difficult to get out.  So if you're camping or running a fan, the liquid wins.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Decent flavor, value...meh.", "unixReviewTime": 1376956800, "reviewTime": "08 20, 2013"}

Now I want more but of course I can't find them.Though.... they need to, NEED TO, find a better way to ship them. First off, I'm paying A LOT for shipping, so I know they can fork it out for something better. Second, when I got them, they had all completely melted, and because well, you know, it's made of a type of chocolate or something similar, they COMPLETELY lost their shape, and being that it's wafers surrounded by the chocolate, that ruins them. It all goes to the end or side or something, anyways, rendering them pretty messed up. Also, once they've melted, they FLAKE EVERYWHERE. That makes them very very hard to eat and to open. I was very bummed. Especially considering texture is 70% of how much I like something. That was disappointing.

Mae Ploy makes both of these tasks quite easy to accomplish. The very best curry is made from making one's own paste, however finding the time and perhaps even more difficult, the ingredients to do so does not compensate for the difference in taste. In my experience, Mae Ploy is an excellent green curry paste that tastes plenty fresh and will give you that same satisfaction that you get from a Thai restaurant.A few things I've learned using their curry pastes over the years:1) If you are cooking for people who are not used to Thai food, the proportions indicated in the directions on the container will be WAY TOO HOT for them. This is especially true with Green Curry and even more important if there will be children eating the meal. It's very easy to adjust the amount of paste used, and with practice you'll learn just how much is good for the experienced palate and how much is good for kids or newbies.2) The packaging doesn't mention anything about how long the product keeps. The paste comes in a plastic container with a lid that can seal, but it's actually in a thick plastic bag inside that container. I used to cut open the bag and leave it in the container, but I've taken to just cutting a hole in the corner and using it like an icer would in a bakery. I feel like the double container might help it to keep a bit longer. Once the bag is opened, the product should be stored in the refrigerator. There is enough in the container to make several curry dishes.3) Mae Ploy paste is fantastic, but choosing a bad coconut milk can degrade the quality of your dish or even ruin it altogether. Don't go with \"lite\" brands, and look for something more authentic if you can find it. I've found Chaokoh brand comes with a higher amount of cream which gives your curry a more consistent flavor. Chaokoh is the brand most often found in Asian markets and I've always figured that they would know best.This product is incredibly easy to use and turns out a Green Curry that will make your friends think yours is good as a restaurant's. I don't believe there is a better paste on the market and when you factor in the price it's a no brainer.

For those going for authenticity - with this paste, non-emulsified coconut milk, Thai apple eggplant, Thai pea eggplant, fish sauce, palm sugar, kaffir lime leaves and Thai basil you can make a beautiful curry with a signature oily green finish that served over quality Jasmine rice will have your Thai friends smile and nod in appreciation.Aside from all the literal time, sweat and tears that go into making an incomparable green curry paste from scratch, the only store bought green curry paste I may rate higher than this is Nittaya brand, for one reason only - in comparison Mae Ploy green curry paste has a higher salt content.  This both limits the balancing that can be done to add the wonderful umami flavour of a quality fish sauce, and it also may make a curry too salty for those who are more health conscious or who are used to low sodium diets.The other factor I'll mention is chili heat only because it has come up in other reviews.  It may be that batches vary in heat content, but for those who are used to Thai spice levels this paste has a very moderate spice level at what I would call a weak to average medium - a slow, sustained heat that comes on surprisingly quickly but which stays at a constant, pleasant burn without peaking into discomfort.

Bernabo", "helpful": [2, 5], "reviewText": "Today Shelley Fabares is best known as the long suffering girl friend and wife on \"Coach,\" but back in 1958 she was Mary Stone, the perfect teenage daughter on the hit ABC domestic comedy, \"The Donna Reed Show.\"  When Ricky Nelson became a singing star because of performances on \"The Adventures of Ozzie &amp; Harriet,\" the producers of \"The Donna Reed Show\" had Fabares and her young co-star former Mousketeer Paul Peterson head into the recording studio of Colpix Records, the label for Columbia Pictures Television.  Fabares was less than thrilled with the idea (she did not believe she had a good singing voice), so it was ironic when her debut release \"Johnny Angel\" reached #1 on the Billboard Pop Charts in early 1962.\"Johnny Angel/How I love him/He's got something that I can't resist/But he doesn't even know that I exist.\"  Every time she passes him in the hall she gets a \"tingle\" and her heart starts to fly every time he says hello.  Other boys want to take her out on dates but she prefers to stay home and dream of the heaven their lives will be when Johnny finally wakes up and notices she is the perfect girl for him.  \"Johnny Angel\" has the standard girl group sound and while Fabares might not have a great singing voice, but her acting training certainly allowed her to use it well in singing this song.  The young girl could have come across as a pathetic lost soul locked away in her room dreaming of a world that is never going to be, but instead Fabares gives her, if not a sense of nobility as she pines away for her love, an undeniable sense of charm as she keeps insisting \"You're an angel to me.\"  Personally, I think she is too good for the guy.The B-Side of this single is \"Where's It Gonna Get Me,\" which takes a more downbeat look at a similar situation.  Both of these tracks are available on Fabares's first album, \"Shelley!\"  So, unless you are really, really into CD-Singles that would be the way to go.  Of course, \"Johnny Angel\" is also on \"The Best of Shelley Fabares\" as well as assorted hits collections from the period.  The song is worth having in your music collection, but I would not suggest this is the best way of getting a copy, unless, as I indicated, you think having classic singles available on CD is kewl.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Shelley Fabares's 1962 #1 hit single: &quot;Johnny Angel&quot;", "unixReviewTime": 1056931200, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2003"}

You could compare my ingredient list to theirs as a way to check whether this review covers the exact same product on this page.)Perhaps the best thing that can be said about this flavor of Power Bar is that it fills you up, and it's not an unpleasant experience.  Perhaps the one I tried had been sitting on the shelf for too long, but it definitely did not taste \"fresh-picked,\" as touted on the Power Bar website. Instead, there was a suggestion of strawberry flavor despite the presence of large pieces of dried fruit.  There was a nice taste of oat flakes--whole oats are the bar's main ingredient (see below).  Alongside this flavor was a cardboard-like texture that definitely fills you up but that tastes tale and gummy.That said, the power bar does fill you up, especially if you drink the suggested 8 glasses of water with it (they don't say over what time interval).  There are 45 grams of carbs, of which 18 are sugar and 4 are fiber.  I don't know what happened to the other 23 grams.

I enjoyed the flavor and it managed to fill me up in place of a regular breakfast.  I didn't get hungry until at least three hours later (and for me that is actually pretty good, I'm always hungry).The main flavor of this bar was the peanut butter. The chocolate barely made an appearance and that was just fine for me.  It was just a surprise here and there when you hit a chip.  The bar was chewy, but not really crunchy from the oats and other grains and fibers that were included in the bar.  It was sweet, and that's to be expected from the sweeteners of brown rice syrup, honey, evaporated can juice syrup and the chocolate chips.  Lots of sweeteners in here making the bar content of sugar 18 grams.  So that is something to watch.The rest of the ingredients were good.  There's whole oats, rice flour, and other pronounceable ingredients throughout.  And a whole list of minerals and vitamins is included so it's even somewhat nutritional for you.  But there are a lot of allergens here as well, as is obvious by the peanut butter flavor.  And another thing of note is that this bar packs a walloping 240 calories.  So use it as a meal replacement or for during vigorous exercise as opposed to a snack.  It would definitely be a good bar for a hiking trip.I liked it and will probably consider it again for breakfast.  It kept me full and I liked the taste, and it will have inspired me to try other PowerBar flavors as well.Review by M.

The amount of protein (23 grams of course) are great, and the calories and saturated fat are slightly higher than your average protein bar (but if you're serious about gaining weight from weight training, it doesn't matter), but that never really worried me--even though I am controlling my calories to lose weight with running and weight lifting.I'm disappointed though on the amount of sugar and lack of dietary fiber it has. 19g is a bit high for me, and 1g is just low. Many of their competitors have 4X the amount of dietary fiber, and a bit less sugar--though this bar does have more protein than your average bar. I know the sugar is needed to help make it taste great, but even I can personally feel its kick, and I would be better off with half the content.I wouldn't mind opting for the reduced sugar variant, but those are  a bit more expensive, and has 26g of sugar alcohol of who knows what.I don't know if I'll ever buy these powerbar proteins again, after I'm done with my 24 pack, since these bars do have a lot of sugar. But if the makers of powerbar manage to cut the sugar content by at least half or even a quarter, and have a little more fiber, I'd buy them regularly!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good overall but..", "unixReviewTime": 1307059200, "reviewTime": "06 3, 2011"}

I was kind of wary of buying these, mainly because Power Bar is kind of a clich&eacute; (shallow, I know).  However, I got a box of 12 for about 15 bucks (on sale) from Amazon, and let me tell you I wasn't disappointed.First off, these similar bars I have seen in stores for 3 bucks a bar.  So already the price of $1.25 per was very appealing.Secondly, these things have a LOT of protein and carbs in them for protein bars (23g).  Similar ones at health food stores usually have 15-18g.Thirdly, and something I wasn't expecting, is these things actually take the edge off your hunger.  I am one of those people that have a high metabolism and is ALWAYS hungry.  When eating these in the morning (I take mass gainers at night, and wanted something high protein as a morning snack) I actually feel satisfied for a couple hours, which never happens.-----Summary:  It's a really good deal if you can get them cheap.  Cheaper than other protein supplements, and actually take the edge off hunger.  I will be purchasing these again.-----Pro Tip:  Different flavors cost different amounts.  I got the Cookies and Cream 12 pk for around 15 bucks, but the chocolate peanut butter were 25 (which I did not purchase).  Let's be honest.  These are protein bars.  They won't be really delicious.

No aftertaste with either, and I actually do prefer a powder at home, with the blender.

It tastes very good and curbs my hunger very well.  Sucralose doesn't give me an aftertaste.  I haven't yet tried with ice cubes, but I've added berries, bananas, peanut butter (no sugar), vanilla, espresso or blackberry powder (for my eyes).My decision is to let Carb Solutions be my mainstay at home for milk type shakes.  Atkins for take with.  I also have a greens, vegetables and fruit powder, as well as blackberry powder, and a joints supplement powder that I will blend with fresh fruits and vegetables, for a change.I allow myself to drink as much as I want of this type of drink and am losing weight.

It is also lots of fun to give to anyone who hasn't had it before.If you don't know what freeze dried ice cream is, it is pretty straight forward. All of the water is removed from normal ice cream in a special way. First the ice cream is kept frozen while a vacuum is applied to it. The vacuum causes water to slowly sublimate and vaporize. The vaporized water is eventually all sucked out and you are left with a chunk of ice cream that has everything in it but water. Note, it doesn't melt. The process brings water straight from the solid to gas. This technique is used for lots of foods because it makes the food last forever -- without water most bacteria and molds simply can't grow.
